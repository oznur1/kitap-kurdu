# Kitap Kurdu
This project is a book management application developed with React.js. I created a backend simulation using JSON Server and managed API requests with Axios. By establishing a multi-page structure with dynamic content management and React Router DOM, I was able to display book details on individual pages. 

# Project Features:
- Dynamic Book List: Book data retrieved from the API is rendered dynamically on the screen.
- Book Search: Users can filter books using the search bar.
- Sorting Options: Ability to list books according to A-Z / Z-A order.
- Book Detail Page: A dynamic detail page was created for each book using React Router DOM.
- Multi-Page Structure: I created a multi-page application with React Router DOM and moved between pages with Link & NavLink structures.
